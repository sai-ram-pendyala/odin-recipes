            Have you ever made a basted egg? If you haven't, it's time to remedy
            that ASAP! Basted eggs are similar to poached eggs, but they're much
            easier to cook. You'll come back to this simple basted egg recipe
            time and time again.
            A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a
            poached egg. Basted eggs are fried on the bottom and steamed on top.
            They look similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is slightly
            more set.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites
                have almost set, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat
                to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are
                still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with
                pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
